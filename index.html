            <p>Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered coronavirus.</p>
            <p>Most people infected with the COVID-19 virus will experience mild to moderate respiratory illness and
                recover
                without requiring special treatment. Older people, and those with underlying medical problems like
                cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, and cancer are more likely to develop
                serious
                illness.</p>
            <p>The best way to prevent and slow down transmission is be well informed about the COVID-19 virus, the
                disease
                it causes and how it spreads. Protect yourself and others from infection by washing your hands or
                using
                an
                alcohol based rub frequently and not touching your face. </p>
            <p>The COVID-19 virus spreads primarily through droplets of saliva or discharge from the nose when an
                infected
                person coughs or sneezes, so itâ€™s important that you also practice respiratory etiquette (for
                example,
                by
                coughing into a flexed elbow).</p>
            <p>At this time, there are no specific vaccines or treatments for COVID-19. However, there are many
                ongoing
                clinical trials evaluating potential treatments. WHO will continue to provide updated information as
                soon as
                clinical findings become available.</p>
