        <li>fever</li>
        <li>tiredness</li>
        <li>dry cough</li>

        <li>runny nose</li>
        <li>sore throat</li>
        <li>diarrhoea</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="paragraphs"> These symptoms are usually mild and begin gradually. Some people become infected but donâ€™t
        develop any symptoms
        and don't feel unwell. Most people (about 80%) recover from the disease without needing special treatment.
        Around 1 out of every 6 people who gets COVID-19 becomes seriously ill and develops difficulty breathing. Older
        people, and those with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, are
        more likely to develop serious illness. People with fever, cough and difficulty breathing should seek medical
        attention.</p>
